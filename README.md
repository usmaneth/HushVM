# Hush Virtual Machine

This is a work in progress virtual machine that is being developed using the Avalanche Rust SDK. The goal of this project is to build a virtual machine that is optimized for decentralized exchanges and includes support for different types of orders, assets, trading pairs, and more.

## Features

- Support for different types of orders, such as limit orders, market orders, and stop orders.
- Ability to handle different types of assets, including cryptocurrencies, tokens, and fiat currencies.
- Support for different trading pairs, such as BTC/ETH or USDT/ETH.
- Integration with external price feeds, such as cryptocurrency exchanges or market data providers.
- Support for arbitrage opportunities, such as automatically executing trades across multiple exchanges to take advantage of price differences.
- Integration with liquidity pools, allowing users to provide liquidity in exchange for a share of the trading fees.
- Support for advanced trading strategies, such as margin trading or futures contracts.
- Integration with external wallets and authentication systems, such as hardware wallets or multi-factor authentication.
- Support for real-time trading data, such as order book depth and trade history.
- Integration with external analytics and reporting tools, such as charting or risk management software.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Rust installed on your computer. You can download and install Rust from the official website (https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Once Rust is installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine and build the project by running the following commands:
git clone (repo) 
cd HushVM
cargo build



## Testing

To test your virtual machine, you can use the Avalanche Rust SDK's `avalanche-cli` tool to interact with a local or remote Avalanche node. This will allow you to test your virtual machine's functionality and behavior on the network.

## Contributions

This project is a work in progress and any contributions are welcome. If you would like to contribute to this project, please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
